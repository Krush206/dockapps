INSTALLATION:     Type at the command line (as root):
-------------
                  make
                  make install

                  If this doesn't work, try xmkmf, make -f Makefile, make install.

                  Or just install the binary rpm:
                  rpm -i wmisdncid-1.2-1.i386.rpm

USAGE:            wmisdncid displays information about the first two
------            isdn devices. displayed information:

                  - "lamps"
                    - green  : offline
                      red    : incoming
                      yellow : outgoing
                      blue   : last two incoming
                               (upper is last, lower is last but one)
                  - letter next to lamps:
                      - v      : voice
                      - r      : raw
                      - f      : fax
                      - m      : modem
                      - n      : net
                  - other digits: caller's/called phone number

                  Click the icon's displays to switch between current
                  and last-incoming call.

                  Run "wmisdncid --help" for a summary of command line
                  options (e.g. -w for withdrawn state for use with
                  WindowMaker).


HINT:             If incoming voice calls are not shown they are probably
-----             not listed in the isdninfo device. You then might need
                  to read a ttyI that waits for rings.

                  There are two possibilities:

                  a) use the -t option:
                     example: -t /dev/ttyI0 12345
                     where 12345 is your local phone number.

                  b) Run a program in the background than constantly
                     waits for anything on a ttyI, readttyIforever.
                     Compile it with
                     "gcc readttyIforever.c -o readttyIforever"
                     Pass a device-name (e.g. /dev/ttyI4) and a MSN as
                     command-line parameters. Example:
                     /usr/local/bin/readttyIforever /dev/ttyI4 123456 &
                     The program will then tell the isdn-device to report
                     incoming calls of all types to the given MSN and read
                     all of it's output to nowhere. The kernel I use reports
                     all incoming calls to the given MSN then.

                  If you know of an easier solution, let me now ;)
