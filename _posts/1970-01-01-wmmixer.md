Mixer application designed for WindowMaker.
wmmixer displays the mixer status of your computer in a small icon.
Most common channels are identified with an appropriate icon. Control
include a stereo (mono where appropriate) volume control and a recording
source toggle button.

It is possible to change between the different channels using two small
buttons (previous channel, next channel) and to change the volume of the
channel.

There's nothing in the program that makes it require WindowMaker, except maybe
the NeXTStep look and the fact that it properly docks. It can be used with
other window managers without problems.
