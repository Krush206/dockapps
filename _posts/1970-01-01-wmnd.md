WMND is a dockapp for monitoring network interfaces under WindowMaker and other compatible window managers. WMND currently works on Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Solaris, OpenSolaris, Darwin and IRIX.

WMND can monitor multiple interfaces at the same time, sports several display modes and can also monitor remote interfaces through SNMP.
