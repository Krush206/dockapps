ABOUT WMsensors.pl
------------------

wmsensors.pl-0.1 by Karsten Eiser <k.eiser@web.de> ©2003
This is a "dock application" for Windowmaker, which monitors the temperature
and voltages of CPU and motherboard and also shows the fan-speed.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
You need a proper configured installation of lmsensors.
The output of the command "sensors" should contain lines like this one.

CPU core:  +1.87 V  (min =  +1.98 V, max =  +2.49 V)   ALARM
+2.5V:     +0.36 V  (min =  +2.24 V, max =  +2.74 V)   ALARM
I/O:       +3.40 V  (min =  +2.95 V, max =  +3.62 V)   
+5V:       +4.89 V  (min =  +4.47 V, max =  +5.49 V)   
+12V:     +12.04 V  (min = +10.79 V, max = +13.18 V)   
CPU Fan:     0 RPM  (min = 3000 RPM, div = 2)          
P/S Fan:     0 RPM  (min = 3000 RPM, div = 2)          
SYS Temp:  +34.4°C  (limit =  +45°C, hysteresis =  +40°C) 
CPU Temp:  +40.3°C  (limit =  +60°C, hysteresis =  +55°C) 
SBr Temp:  +24.8°C  (limit =  +65°C, hysteresis =  +60°C) 

INSTALLATION
------------

First step:
	Be sure you have installed the Perlmodule "Wharf::JDockApp" from the CPAN.
	If you didn't have this Perlmodule type on the shell:
	$ perl -MCPAN -e 'install Wharf::JDockApp'
	(This will install the needed Perl-module)

Second step:
	$ cp wmsensors.pl /usr/local/bin
	
Third step:
	Run wmsensors.pl
	$ wmsensors.pl or
	$ wmsensors.pl --help 

Fourth step:
	Have a lot of fun ;-)
